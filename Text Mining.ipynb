Unlike other banks with which I do business, the NASB website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries. For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled. However, when the escrow amount changed, NASB debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited. NASB sent me a \"credit counseling letter\" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services. When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current. Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB\\'s default department. The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me. The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that NASB\\'s system was not set up to adjust anything. After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service. I specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran\\xa0',\n",

What I didn\\'t count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife\\'s departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now \"too old.\" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn\\'t care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn\\'t kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn\\'t pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I\\'ve ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I\\'d rate this Bank lower than one star',\n",

My original lender had offered to pay for my home appraisal in writing, and, wanting to compete, Kirk said he would pay for the appraisal (which he stated in writing) and asked for the letter the other lender had provided so he could get permission to have Pacific Beneficial pay for my appraisal. Kirk confirmed I would not be paying for the appraisal and was very happy with what Kirk was doing to accommodate me as a customer. However, when I closed on the home, the cost of the appraisal was on my Final Buyer’s Statement ($525). As Kirk had said that I would not be paying for the appraisal, I thought I would be reimbursed. I reached out to Kirk via email after close and got no further response than “We paid for appraisal upfront but we get reimbursed.” I then reached out to Kirk two times via email with no response. I then called the office and spoke to Kirk’s boss’ admin who instructed me to reach out to Kirk’s boss, Adam Carrion, which I did. It was only then that I received an email response from Kirk stating that the lender credit I received, which was less than the appraisal, was all I would receive to cover the cost, despite the fact that when I was entering into the loan Kirk told me that Pacific Beneficial would be paying for the appraisal and I would be receiving a lender credit. Kirk asked me to call him, which I did and left a voicemail, and he never called me back. I called Kirk again leaving a voicemail with no response. I then began reaching out to his boss Adam Carrion via email to continue to explain the situation. Only then did I receive an email from Kirk asking me to call him, which I did, left a voicemail, and received no response. I then called Adam and spoke to him on the phone and only then did I receive a call from Kirk, offering me a nominal amount of money. I stated that I wanted to be reimbursed for the entire appraisal amount and he said he would go back to the powers that be to see what he could do. I never heard from him. I reached out to Kirk and Adam via email to check in on status with no response. The next day I reached out again, voicing my displeasure and that I was going to take action via reviews.

What I didn\\'t count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife\\'s departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now \"too old.\" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn\\'t care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn\\'t kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application.

I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues.

Then five days later (while driving from ID to NC) I had to coordinate having closing docs (which I already sent to them) from the sale of my other home sent to me so I could send to them. Of the four houses I purchased in the past 9 years this was the most stressful... Read More\\r\\n        \",\n",

We have excellent credit, plenty of income, etc. NASB rep made tons of promises to get us to sign up, but then just a few weeks before the closing, she just disappeared, and failed to give us a lock or firm closing date! Thankfully, we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with lower rates in only 3 weeks. NASB rep constantly complained about being too busy and having too many matters to work on; this became very apparent towards the end. Not sure to this day why she didn't want our business other than they apparently cannot follow through for some reason or another. I'm sure there are good lenders here, but this is not one of them...

In fact, from my initial round of calls, I thought I was going to select him out of the five Lending Tree lenders (plus two banks I talked to directly). But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying \"OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him \"thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate.\" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying \"when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know\". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn\\'t really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too.

I asked her to send me the good faith estimate. The good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of $2929 which is about $600 more than she mentioned during our conversation. When I called her for explanation of the extra $600 she said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. What an explanation!!!! She knew my state from the beginning and I repeatedly asked her for a 'TOTAL' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. As a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a 'STATE TAX' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. I am not supposed to know what are the different compoents/fees or taxes that apply during closing. She does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning.

       " '\\r\\nThe Interest rate offered and time to close being short sold us on the loan so we pursued it despite -\\r\\n1. the fact that a credit check and underwriting was made when per VA rules for an IRRRL these were not necessary and we were assured by Mr. Owens when first discussing the refinancing they would not be made. \\r\\n2. the constant errors in the paperwork. One huge error was the Loan Estimate had rolled in initial escrow funding into the loan amount when we expressly communicated at the beginning that we did not want to finance it but pay for it at closing from available funds. Another was not classifying the currently owed property taxes as a prepaid for immediate disbursement to the county but trying to collect it at closing rolling it into the initial escrow account to be paid in December just a month later during the time NASB intended to sell the mortgage. Thankfully this was corrected by the Closing Agent.\\r\\n3. Mr. Owens not being straight with us about NASB\\'s intent to sell the mortgage after closing. His statements of first saying NASB would not consider a sale and intended to keep the mortgage on its books then after the statement it would be sold appeared in the Loan Estimate saying a sale was not definite but only there \"just in case it had to be sold sometime in the future.\" Since today, just 5 days after disbursement, I find out that our mortgage is on the books for immediate sale shows Mr. Owens likely knew of a definite sale and tried to mislead us by saying it wasn\\'t definite. \\r\\n4. taking 4 calendar days to address errors and issues in the initial Closing Document which prevented us from knowing the amount we were financing and the amount we needed to pay at closing which was supposed to be made through a certified check until 15 minutes prior to arrival at the Closing Agent\\'s place of business.\\r\\nPros allow for the Neutral instead of bad rating because the \"despites\" show that the customer support during this loan process was extremely poor and unacceptable.\\r\\n...

What I didn\\'t count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife\\'s departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now \"too old.\" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn\\'t care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn\\'t kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry.

Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation...

I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check.

When I called her for explanation of the extra $600 she said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. What an explanation!!!! She knew my state from the beginning and I repeatedly asked her for a 'TOTAL' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. As a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a 'STATE TAX' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. I am not supposed to know what are the different compoents/fees or taxes that apply during closing. She does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning.

and took the time to educate me about the process along the way  i highly recommend working with zach and wyndham capital i had the pleasure of working with wyndham capital in september      as my family and i were making a home purchase in columbus  oh  from the original conversation with the loan officer to underwriting and all the way through closing  the entire team from wyndham was very responsive and professional  i was very impressed with how smooth their process was and how timely the communication was given how stressful of a process home buying  and selling  can bemy experience with mattison was beyond greatly professionally done   she really cares about her clients needs  she stays on top of everything and if there was a misunderstanding  she would be on top of it for you  overall she truly bends her back professionally for her clients  she is a wonderful person patrick answered all my questions by email immediately and he spent a lot of time making sure i got the right loan for my situation  the portal they use is extremely easy and we closed on the refinance with   weeks  very pleased with the customer service and intend on using patrick again when we refinance later    i loved working with this group of people  they laughed with me over the phone  always answered my questions and moved the loan along as quickly as possible  knowledgeable staff  while we were shopping around for a lender  one lender badmouthed wyndham  they lost my business because of it  when i told wyndham about it  they had the class not to say anything negative about another company  just to get the  sell great web interface for both the loan application and document upload and download features  quick responses to any questions or concerns  willingness to communicate almost exclusively via email   as phone calls weren t always an option for us working with michelle and wyndham went really well for me  as a first time homeowner and this being my first refinance  i feel that this process was smooth and successful  i will definitely recommend michelle to friends and family usten butler brought the humanity and connection to what can be a very stiff  lifeless  and scary transaction  not only that  it is quite possibly the largest purchase my wife and i will ever make  we didn t simply want to transact with a faceless institution  a lot was riding on picking the right house and making sure everything would work out  austen was there for us  every step of the way  it s true  austen got us the best deal  yes  that s also true  but it s more than that  from when we first starting looking to over a year later when we found the home we wanted  his presence  positivity  and guidance gave us the confidence to take the step and move into our dream home  it s made a huge difference for our family  we re right where we want to be  have    kids on our block  and couldn t be happier   and it s all thanks to austen butler s help jay was easy to get a hold of if i had any questions so that was huge to me because there s a lot to do during this whole loan process and you want to know if everything s right  he provided as great a service as i could ve wantedif i had a million friends i would recommend all of them to wyndham capital especially to mark taylor he s great he really help with even of the clock thanks a million mark i mean that from heart i appreciate everything you did for me chaz was fantastic throughout the entire lending processs  i had my share of challenges with the original underwriter through no fault of chase yet he stepped in quickly to rectify any issues i had  he was the glue that kept this deal together  i did have some challenges with my first property falling through and the last minute yet chaz kept my spirits up and assisted through quickly transitioning to the new and much better property in the end  again  cannot say enough positive things about chaz  consummate professional and very responsive  i would highly recommend doing business with him and plan on staying in touch for future opportunitiesausten has been awsome in every step of the way with my refi and new home purchase  he explains your best options thoroughly with out any of the b s other companies use to get your business   being a repeat customer says it all the salesperson kept pushing a cash out refi on me even when i told him i m looking for a heloc specifically  then he hangs up on me because i said i was quoted a better rate at td bank  ridiculous    this was the worst experience ever  it was like they had never gone through the process before  i could not get a complete list of the documents required  every other day it was a new request  the appraiser that they hired made so many mistakes i had to send in corrections and then during the underwriting process they had to go back and make more corrections  wyndum would continue to ask for copies of documents over and over again  there were many documents that i had to send   and   times because they  lost  them or was not filed correctly  we went through   different people through the process  i would never use them  awful experience a good rate but a very frustrating process  constant delays  decisions made then changed  overwhelmed underwriting team with   week back log  rookie mistake related to texas law that caused an additional   week wait  closing happened almost   weeks after it should have  courteous and professional  but not very knowledgeable and no sense of urgency  would not recommendthey were not upfront  learn from my mistake    i trusted the loan officer that my zero point rate is an option before closing the loan because he convinced me to initially sign the good faith estimate with higher rate plus lender s credit  after running my numbers  the lower interest is favorable for me and asking for it now  i m being charge points  it looks like they are only good in their words at the beginning so please be careful dealing with this lenderinitially  the mortgage broker was very friendly and assertive  once the paper work was filled out and closing on the loan was eminent  it became increasingly difficult to reach the

military  tough income verification  with five families all swapping homes  tons of contingencies   everything along the way mattered and aaron and the nasb team got it done  even on weekends  and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees  look  do not pass up an opportunity to work with him  the nasb team went above and beyond for me and my family and closed an important va home loan on time despite many changes  my military retirement  and a very challenging antebellum home that required the entire nasb team to pull out all the stops  know the rules and regulations  and guide us through a tough va process  i truly believe we would not have closed on time with a different team  i will only recommend nasb for home loans   especially complicate va loansdallas goodlet and his entire team are deserving a special thank you  he was as professional as they come and closed our loan in    days  we were with another competitor originally and he called  saving us thousands over our current lender  it was a real pleasure getting to work with this institution and a class act like dallas  great job comments  to begin my wife and i were at the point of signing completion with the leader of online home mortgage service  we were not satisfied with the origination cost so we applied to lending tree for competitive bids  several lender matched or slightly beat nasb but none were convincing at closing on time  we chose nasb because of dallas goodlet believability on the closing  the sales  loan service and application process was competitive  assuring  professional  timely  supportive  and truthful  dallas goodlet  brent custer and the whole nasb team delivered the mortgage on time and at the price promised  we are completely

experience we have ever had  bryant makes it easy and took the time to discuss the best options for us  i ve never met bryant  but you can t mistake authenticity and we knew instantly he and nasb were who we were going with  best loan officer i could have hoped for  jeff exceeded my expectations  he worked very hard to get me the best rate possible  highly recommendedadam was great to work with during our refi  his attention to detail made this a smooth and easy transaction  it has been several years since we ve gone thru the home loan process and we were unsure where to start  after talking with adam  we were confident he was the one to help us with our refi  he was professional  helpful  very knowledgeable about the loan process and answered all of our questions in a timely manner  i would highly recommend adam and would not hesitate to work with him agaigreat website  knowledgeable  responsive and always got back to us quickly with answers to our questions  mortgage process can be very tedious and they made it easy we received offers from multiple banks after our lending tree request for a mortgage  alex madewell from nasb was by far the best offer  he made the entire process easy and was very knowledgeable  the closing on this home was seamless  no surprises  i would definitely recommend alex madewell and nasb to anyone looking for a mortgage rob was very helpful in getting this loan closed  few issues on our end we didn t know about but he was still able to get it done on time peter and his team were great to work with  they were professional and prompt with their responses  they answered all my questions and somehow got us to closing on time despite various roadblocks we encountered adam came highly recommended and from the first time we spoke with him  it was clear why  he was friendly  professional  knowledgeable  and worked hard to ensure we were taken care of in all aspects  beyond the necessary effective communication skills  he brought a personal touch after we closed by sending us a hand written note of congratulations  i will recommend him to everyone i know buying a house the closing process for a va loan went smoothly  but the loan servicing by this so called bank is a complete disaster  i set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website  unlike other banks with which i do business  the nasb website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries  for the first    months  payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled  however  when the escrow amount changed  nasb debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance    unlike every other bank i have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited  nasb sent me a  credit counseling letter  telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of     and change      and suggested credit counseling services  when i called their servicing department  the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current  two weeks later  i received a total of two voice mail messages and an e mail in a span of    minutes from nasb s default department  the woman with whom i first spoke was rude  said she showed no record of my earlier call  it was my problem  and then hung up on me  the second agent  a man in their default department  said that he did not show that i had made any automatic payments and that nasb s system was not set up to adjust anything  after having over    years of mortgage payments with various banks  i have never experienced such incompetence and rude service  i specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran miserable experience  they screwed up everything imaginable and never accepted responsibility for any of their errors  i wouldnt recommend them for the purchase of a doghouse much less purchasing a new home our loan officer was happy to communicate before we committed  once we committed he only communicated with us after i questioned items and problems and after i questioned why we weren t settling before our rate lock expired  we had no idea where we were in the process unless i contacted steve  poor  poor communication  mr  kang also was  sure  our house would appraise for    k more than our house did  talking us into a loan that we didn t end up appraising for and then causing us to have to refinance at only     lower than our current mortgage  our appraiser was disorganized and called twice for pictures he forgot  he used poor comps  we were contacted several times to look at documents that were expired before we could even sign on  within minutes of the email notifications   only good was the actual settlement with a very sweet and competent notary  and thank goodness we were done   poor process  poor communication   we will never recommend nasb and i have already told two people refinancing to steer clear  started refinance with nick things were going ok then there was a problem with a credit card fro   years earlier  which must of made the loan not possible  this i would of understood  but i never heard from them again  called nick several times no response  i even called his supervisor no response  e mailed them no response  is this the company you want to due busness   this loan started off quite well  our rep  donna  was friendly and quick to respond to questions  she clearly explained how things would unfold  and it all sounded great  what i didn t count on was that the bank never kept a single promise she made  i had the same problem with this bank    or more times  i would ask for assurance about something  donna would respond that things would be completed as i wished  and her promise was violated by the bank every single time  for example  in our first or second conversation  i explained to donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country    weeks after beginning the loan process  would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that  not at all  she said  we should close several weeks before my wife s departure     weeks later  the bank was not ready to close  how did that happen  donna would ask us to email documentation  which we would email back within      hours  depending on the occasion  donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great  and the bank had everything it needed  then  weeks later  they would ask for additional documentation  this happened   or more times  later in the process  they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had i provided was now  too old   i cannot tell if this patterns recured because the bank doesn t care about customers  or because it is just incompetent  every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn t kept  donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry  but she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises  we finally closed    weeks or so after our initial application  i can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not

satisfied and kept in the loop on my loan process everyday          i was looking for a way to consolidate my current debt when i submitted a loan request to lending tree  i received an email from steven shatz and decided to give him a call to see what he could offer based on his reviews on lending tree  once we started talking i knew that he was willing to work with me to get my best option on the table  we settled and closed fairly quickly and he worked through a few issues with me right by my side  he was always a phone call  text or email away and never delayed in returning my messages

knowledgeable  professional and worked with me to answer any questions   had a problem in the courseof my application that was dealt with quickly and was solved    i would recommend reliance to anyone         after spending   months trying to complete an application for a loan with little or no success  i found patrick at reliance   i was kept informed on aregular basis of what was happening  what was needed and the time line for closing   great experience         wesley white worked tirelessly and patiently to get our loan approved and closed despite our several obstacles and challenges  he was very responsive  reassuring  and encouraging  even if you have a complicated situation  you can trust him to work as hard as possible to help you meet your goals  we would definitely call on him again for all of our lending needs         very professional and answered and returned calls very fast  great communication with the whole process          buyer beware   to make it short and sweet  shop around and find someone who knows what they are talking about  there were certain expenses that i had to pay before closing  but was assured i would get a refund  or reliance would pay for it and it would reflect in the final closing documents  this did not happen  termite inspection required by va  was        i was told i would get this back  nope  her answer   oh  the rules changed some time back  and i didn t know about it   was also told  if it closed late  which it did  reliance would pick up the late fee for my present mortgage which she told me not to pay  yep  they paid it  with my proceeds  then to pay off the loan  which was the reason for the refinance  they send me a check payable to the lender  and then i have to overnight it to the lender so i don t get hit with another late fee  why    could t they just do an electronic payment   not happy    read more        the team was not aware of some critical information which delayed my refinancing for several months   finally upon completion which was also several weeks later than promised  the pay off checks to my creditors were all wrong  due to late fees and next payments   chris thomas was very cordial and forthcoming   he stayed in constant contact  but overall  the company and its delays and incorrect balances  due to delays would make it impossible for me to recommend the company as a whole    read

frustrated with him he is so arrogant   every time we talked he would always say  let me call you back in about   or    minutes   i wouldnt hear from him for a couple of days and this happened probably   to    times  it wasnt all extremely bad we did have to raise my credit score which took probably a month but it took a little over   months to get everything said and done then he lost some of my paper work we had to get that redone then i also had my motorcycle added consolidation   it was supposed to be a     percent payoff well i didnt get all the money to pay my bike off again  let me call the title company and ill call you back in   or    min  didnt hear from him  so i called back the next day   what    read more        reliance first capital was very professional and did what they said they would do  in this day and age that is very rare  it made it a pleasure doing business with them  i couldn t be more pleased  thanks            i thought they seemed very nice at first  played phone tag then got a letter in the mail stateing that i was not interested so they would not do anything more on my file  i left messages andd emailed that that was incorrect  have not heard from them since  maybe they should have said they were not interested  im in dier straights and need help         the experience with reliance was extremely frustrating and aggravating  first the loan  mgr  asked for the usual pile of paper  including the     t to prove i paid my taxes  fine  but then they wanted copies of my tax returns so they could compare  since when are they tax auditors  unable to find the copy for       i had the irs send us the transcript of it  and sent it via po  and electronically  but then it was held up for   weeks because the transcript was mailed by us  and not the irs  now we are getting ridiculous  so we had the irs fax it to them directly  and still they had a problem with it s  authenticity   they received everything we had  with no discrepancies  yet the loan mgr suggested we go ahead and  dummy up  a copy  as long as it would match exactly  we said no  the two separate transcripts were accurate  and they could use those  or we would walk  amazing that a week later they finally approved it  this guy had emailed and called every day  sometimes as many as   times  even during our christmas trip to dallas  only to sit and wait  and wonder what the black hole was doing  and to make it more annoying  he had a demeaning way of speaking  saying  does that make sense    after every statement  as if i couldn t understand basic english  one of those things people say when they want people to feel inferior  they requested the     t   more times  so we sent them at least   to make sure  so that didn t  make sense   nor did their inability to accept the irs transcripts sent from the irs  nor the harassment for other tax copies while we were visiting my sons in dallas over christmas  i certainly would not want my friends to feel my frustration    read more        person with whom i spoke kept interrupting me and telling me his  line  rather than listening to what info i wanted  quite pushy  altho  he said he wasn t a salesman  closing costs were astronomical         based on results i have to give   star  my initial conversations was over the course of an hour  i provided all my info and based on that anthony said he would give me   options moving forward  the next day we talked he had zero options for me and said i wasn t approved   it was a waste of a credit pull         months after i spoke to one person at amerisave  got the information i needed and decided not to refi  i continue to get calls from reliance whose employees do not seem to know what  i am not interested means    if i would have known that clicking one co to get information meant that all other cos  would call  i would have never looked online for information   what more do you have to do to get this co to stop calling      read more

very unpleasant    read more        worst lending experience of my life  my point of contact provided incorrect information from the start  this led me to spend money on items such as appraisal  which cost not quite twice as much as any other appraisal company in the area  and termite inspection  after putting charges on credit i had no choice but to close the loan to pay off new debt  oh yes  one of those payments they have not made yet and they have yet to explain why  won t return my calls  can you say hello lawyer    read more        i feel they made promises that they could not keep and made some mistakes that personally cost me around         i would have canceled the loan a few different times if my finances would have allowed it i would not recommend this company to any of my friends           i had an awful experience with reliance when refinancing my home   i would not recommend them to anyone   among other issues  it is now   weeks after we closed and i am still waiting for the check that i was told that i would receive at closing   not weeks after closing   do not use this company             slow   it took over   months to close   nd financial disclosure had an increase in borrowing amount   servicer said the increase was due to taxes being under estimated when  in fact  it was an increase in points   i thought my rate had been locked they did not want to use my attorney so i went with theirs   without notifying me  their attorney did not do the closing   a notary came to the house in a t shirt   the notary said he could not give legal advice so if we had any legal questions about the documents  we were out of luck  despite paying      for an attorney   later  i learned their attorney was sanctioned by the nc state bar in      for conduct related to real estate closings    read more        my experience with reliance wasn t good at all   st off they ran   hard inquires on my credit that i did not authorize and i am in the process of pursuing

next year almost and still not closed and i am still getting request from the loan processor  its absolutely ridiculous   rd it took so long for them to close that the rate they offered me      went up to     and i wasn t even notified until i got documentation from reliance  they did not lock me in to the initial rate like they should have   rd i decided not to use them for the refi because of all the errors and mistakes that were made by them  i m going to file a better business bureau complaint as well as other complaints about my experience  do not use them    read more        nothing

loan for automatic payments using their clunky website   unlike other banks with which i do business  the nasb website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries for the first    months  payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled   however  when the escrow amount changed  nasb debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance    unlike every other bank i have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited nasb sent me a  credit counseling letter  telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of     and change      and suggested credit counseling services   when i called their servicing department  the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current two weeks later  i received a total of two voice mail messages and an e mail in a span of    minutes from nasb s default department   the woman with whom i first spoke was rude  said she showed no record of my earlier call  it was my problem  and then hung up on me   the second agent  a man in their default department  said that he did not show that i had made any automatic payments and that nasb s system was not set up to adjust anything after having over    years of mortgage payments with various banks  i have never experienced such incompetence and rude service   i specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran    read more        miserable experience  they screwed up everything imaginable and never accepted responsibility for any of their errors  i wouldnt recommend them for the purchase of a doghouse much less purchasing a new home          our loan officer was happy to communicate before we committed  once we committed he only communicated with us after i questioned items and problems and after i questioned why we weren t settling before our rate lock expired  we had no idea where we were in the process unless i contacted steve  poor  poor communication  mr  kang also was  sure  our house would appraise for    k more than our house did  talking us into a loan that we didn t end up appraising for and then causing us to have to refinance at only     lower than our current mortgage  our appraiser was disorganized and called twice for pictures he forgot  he used poor comps  we were contacted several times

we weren t interested in and then causing us to have to refinance at only     lower than our current mortgage  our appraiser was disorganized and called twice for pictures he forgot  he used poor comps  we were contacted several times to look at documents that were expired before we could even sign on  within minutes of the email notifications   only good was the actual settlement with a very sweet and competent notary  and thank goodness we were done   poor process  poor communication   we will never recommend nasb and i have already told two people refinancing to steer clear    read more        started refinance with nick things were going ok then there was a problem with a credit card fro   years earlier  which must of made the loan not possible  this i would of understood  but i never heard from them again  called nick several times no response  i even called his supervisor no response  e mailed them no response  is this the company you want to due busness with                read more        can someone explain why the apr is more than a point higher than the interest rate  if there are    fees           this loan started off quite well  our rep  donna  was friendly and quick to respond to questions  she clearly explained how things would unfold  and it all sounded great  what i didn t count on was that the bank never kept a single promise she made  i had the same problem with this bank    or more times  i would ask for assurance about something  donna would respond that things would be completed as i wished  and her promise was violated by the bank every single time  for example  in our first or second conversation  i explained to donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country    weeks after beginning the loan process  would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that  not at all  she said  we should close several weeks before my wife s departure     weeks later  the bank was not ready to close  how did that happen  donna would ask us to email documentation  which we would email back within      hours  depending on the occasion  donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great  and the bank had everything it needed  then  weeks later  they would ask for additional documentation  this happened   or more times  later in the process  they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had i provided was now  too old   i cannot tell if this patterns recured because the bank doesn t care about customers  or because it is just incompetent  every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn t kept  donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry  but she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises  we finally closed    weeks or so after our initial application  i can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the bank on the day they made it  and if we hadn t pushed hard to get this deal done  this bank treats customers with complete disrespect  as someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than    home mortgages from different banks  i can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience i ve ever had  you owe it to yourself to work with another bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers  if i could  i d rate this bank lower than one star    read more        built new home and wanted to get a small mortgage compared to the value of the property  the process took much longer than i was told it would causing mishandling and reverification of information provided to nasb  there was a difference of opinion on what was necessary to close the loan that made the process diffiicult on my family  i would not recommend north american savings bank as amortgage lender    read more        this lender contacted my previous phone number which i did not list when registering with this site  very unprofessional  and very disturbing         i never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as i  that mistake was using north american savings bank over other lenders  i started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time  communication with the company was below average after i confirmed that i would be pursuing a loan with them  i had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me  the company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn t  this led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent  after having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped  when i was able to reach the loan officer i was told that i would personally have to find additional comps in my area  i was more than a little annoyed as this is what i was going to be paying them for  however i complied  after contacting area realtors and securing what i believe were suitable comps i forwarded them to the officer  a week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered  at that time i was told that my comps weren t sufficient and as a result they couldn t ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment s findings  as a result they would not be issuing me a loan  by the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point  i should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me  he did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me  i m now stuck with a      assessment that other banks are telling me that i can t use  in other words i will have to pay for a new assessment  i m also out the money for credit reports and of course i ll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan i secure  i was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money i had spent  i expect to be paying for my mistake for years  i should point out that i refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues  i strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass north american savings bank no matter what they promise  save yourself time  money and a lot of aggravation    read more        it all started when bob g ran a credit check without my knowledge or consent  when i agreed to use nasb  bob told me that they could close in less than   weeks   it took    the day before closing they were still asking for paperwork  the day of closing  while my household goods were being unpacked  i was told a power of attorney could not be used  i had to fly to id  where my wife was  take the docs to a notary and fedex them back  i also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn t accept a personal check  then five days later  while driving from id to nc  i had to coordinate having closing docs  which i already sent to them  from the sale of my other home sent to me so i could send to them  of the four houses i purchased in the past   years this was the most stressful    read more        what a horrible experience  we have excellent credit  plenty of income  etc  nasb rep made tons of promises to get us to sign up  but then just a few weeks before the closing  she just disappeared  and failed to give us a lock or firm closing date  thankfully  we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with lower rates in only   weeks  nasb rep constantly complained about being too busy and having too many matters to work on  this became very apparent towards the end  not sure to this day why she didn t want our business other than they apparently cannot follow through for some reason or another  i m sure there are good lenders here  but this is not one of them    read more        rep was extremely professional  friendly  and helpful when we first spoke  in fact  from my initial round of calls  i thought i was going to select him out of the five lending tree lenders  plus two banks i talked to directly   but then when i sent an email to all the lenders saying  ok  the contract is signed  i want to select a lender and lock my rate tomorrow  so please send me your best current rate and fees etc  with these exact loan parameters  it took the rep from nasb over a week to respond  so i replied to him  thanks but you are too late  i have selected someone else and already locked my rate   over the following few weeks i continued to receive emails from him saying  when you are ready to proceed with your loan  let me know   we closed on january  th  and on february  th i got another such email  i guess he didn t really ever read my emails  i also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat  but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too  at the end of round one  his rates and fees were very competitive though   pretty near the best of the bunch    read more        i was working with a loan consultant from nasb and she told me that she would give me a rate of        for a    year fixed loan with a total closing cost of        i asked her to send me the good faith estimate  the good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of       which is about      more than she mentioned during our conversation  when i called her for explanation of the extra      she said that there is a state tax        which she was not aware of  what an explanation     she knew my state from the beginning and i repeatedly asked her for a  total  closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be        as a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a  state tax  that might come later and should have mentioned that to me  i am not supposed to know what are the different compoents fees or taxes that apply during closing  she does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning  i expected honest communication from a loan consultant from nasb bank and i did not receive that  i am very disappointed    read more        the interest rate offered and time to close being short sold us on the loan so we pursued it despite     the fact that a credit check and underwriting was made when per va rules for an irrrl these were not necessary and we were assured by mr  owens when first discussing the refinancing they would not be made     the constant errors in the paperwork  one huge error was the loan estimate had rolled in initial escrow funding into the loan amount when we expressly communicated at the beginning that we did not want to finance it but pay for it at closing from available funds  another was not classifying the currently owed property taxes as a prepaid for immediate disbursement to the county but trying to collect it at closing rolling it into the initial escrow account to be paid in december just a month later during the time nasb intended to sell the mortgage  thankfully this was corrected by the closing agent    mr  owens not being straight with us about nasb s intent to sell the mortgage after closing  his statements of first saying nasb would not consider a sale and intended to keep the mortgage on its books then after the statement it would be sold appeared in the loan estimate saying a sale was not definite but only there  just in case it had to be sold sometime in the future   since today  just   days after disbursement  i find out that our mortgage is on the books for immediate sale shows mr  owens likely knew of a definite sale and tried to mislead us by saying it wasn t definite     taking   calendar days to address errors and issues in the initial closing document which prevented us from knowing the amount we were financing and the amount we needed to pay at closing which was supposed to be made through a certified check until    minutes prior to arrival at the closing agent s place of business pros allow for the neutral instead of bad rating because the  despites  show that the customer support during this loan process was extremely poor and unacceptable     read more        they increased my rate  quoted me different closing costs   different times  took   months to get to closing  and needed information that should not have mattered in the least         we worked with jon barrett in processing our refinance loan  this was a very quick and issue free process  i appreciated how jon kept us up to date through the whole process explaining the process as we went through it         the rate re lock in rule was not followed         good news the      processing fee was waived the rate was locked for    days but they closed in   weeks  i did not have to pay for an extension they have also floated my rate down     percent without any fees until the closing i did not pay anything other than a credit history check fee not so good news this was a very long and frustrating experience i do believe that the process took longer than expected mostly because of the busy refinance season i might be a difficult customer or may be just unlucky but there was always a problem with every stage and detail of my refinance experience i am trying not to blame the  loan consultant   byron housworth  for this whenever i asked about any time line  the answer was fixed  in a week or so   i had to wait for    nine  weeks to close it was my luck that his vacation week was in the middle of my process if nasb needs a document they will wait until the last minute and then come back  oh we need this document or else we can t continue when you have that one taken care of  they will wait  a week or so  to get back to you and next week you will hear  it turns out we also need this document this went on and on  the day before the closing they would email me and say  we just noticed that we didn t have your employment verification done   hours before closing  oh we just found out that we don t have your home insurance verification and we can t reach them i called the insurance company and in ten minutes it was taken care of i don t know how many times i had to hear  this should be ok  and turns out it is not ok many many times they assured me they have all the information they need   but this was never the case they were not very careful  they missed out all the details  they wasted weeks and weeks because they were not able to go through a check list and see if they have taken care of everything they always say  we are too busy with a lot of applications   i believe they shouln t accept applications that they can t process sample communication me  why am i being charged for such and such respond  we are not charging you for that me  please check the final hud line xxrespond  sorry i didn t go down that far me     some of my favorite quotes from them  sorry  don t come across this too often    wasn t aware of that     this should work   can you possibly call them again  we need it asap   thank you for your patience   tgif      i had to hear this     times they are not bad people  but you need a lot of patience dealing with them do i suggest working with them only if you are not under any time pressure only if you can work hard for your own application only if you have a lot of patience overall  i feel like nasb is an ok bank to work with  but i don t think i could handle this hassle again    read more        where as we did not end up taking a loan from this company  i can comment on the fact that the broker matt was quick to try to get my business  as soon as he found that there were complications with the mortgage insurance he stopped having any contact with me  he would not return my calls  or emails  once i finally got a hold of him he was short with his answers and offer little help when i asked for details on the complications  we went with a different company for our loan    read more        this closing went pretty smooth with the exception of a few bumps  the customer service agent was prompt with responses as well as document transfers  i was not keen on doing a refinance all electronic through email and phone  but i have to say  the process was easy and went well  i got a great rate and the closing costs were good the only issue i had was at closing  the final documents were written for a    year loan and it was suppose to be a    year loan  an issue happened at the final writing so i did not close on the specified closing date  it happened a day later after the papers were rewritten  it was great they were able to resolve it in one day  the bad part was i got charged a rate lock extension fee as my rate lock expired on the day i was suppose to close  i am sure i could have fought them on the fee as it was caused because of their mistake but now i was closing on new years eave and did not want to carry the closing over to the new year    read more        great

not recommend         while william was fine  my loan officer  and was at times very good  this entire experience was horrible when it came down to the actual processing and closing  the underwriter did not tell me about additional items needed until the very last week before closing  and i feel that she should have been able to give me that list when i called to check status   to       weeks prior  at that point i was told that everything was good to go and just waiting on the appraisal  i live in hawaii and buying here means that there is a   day lag time from when you sign to when the closing is actual  the items she was demanding would take       business days to get and i had already purchased my airline ticket  shipped my vehicle and household goods  there was no compassion and it came across as she was the word of god and i would have to bow her will  the company did not even offer any assistance for having to pay for the changes i had to do with my time and schedule as well as the airfare  they only care when it comes to getting your money  with buying being stressful as it is  this was uncalled for from the companies side and they need to reevaluate their processes

follow up to my phone call  my loan mgr daniel dunlop stopped working with me because he said he wasn t making enough money from my loan and was pulled off  this was after weeks of not hearing from anyone to find out what was going on with my loan  i finally called the corporate office in chicago when no one was calling me back  they had freddy western the branch manager call me and his follow

refinancing to reinstate my va certificate of eligibility toward purchase of a home  since the rate was available elsewhere  i hired gr based on the broker s claim that the transaction could be completed within     weeks or less  i formally began the process with guaranteed rate on july    based on broker feedback that the transaction was in underwriting on july   rd  we planned the closing date on our new home purchase for   month later and i alerted va  this refinance didn t close with gr until a full month later  aug     and the loan was funded on aug     i came within   days of missing a rate lock date on the other new home purchase mortgage because of this communications from the broker was horrible  as i mentioned  in parallel with this effort  i was going through the process of obtaining a home purchase mortgage from another company  so i have a great basis of comparison  i received no information from guaranteed rate without having to ask for it  when i did receive information  it was minimal  typically  yes  or  no  answer   so i had to follow up with additional questions to get clarification on details  i don t do this for a living  that s why i hired gr  i definitely did not receive my money s worth  if i m to believe the broker  my loan package spent       weeks in underwriting  btw  my credit scores are all above      so there was no issue there

i would not recommend this mortgage company at all  they were very prompt to answer but as soon as they got the appraisal and find out i wasn t able to refinance they didn t return any of my calls  in fact i had to call to find out the appraisal report bad service         i am new to home buying  before i make such a huge decision  i like to ask lots of questions  including questions about how mortgages work  i want to make sure i am informed enough to at least have a shot at making an intelligent decision i had asked similar questions of several other lenders who contacted me through this site and they were all very polite and happy to answer my questions  aaron however  seemed to have an attitude from the moment i picked up the phone and appeared to become more annoyed as i asked more questions his general tone was one of rudeness and condescension  the conversation ended  when aaron cut me off in the middle of a question and said  well let me ask you this  what didn t you understand about what i just said   at that point i informed him that our conversation was over and i would not be doing business with his company i m not sure why aaron and guaranteed rate  inc  think it s acceptable to treat people this way  but if you have expectations similar to mine  you may disappointed with their service on the bright side  they aren t the only game in town  there are plenty of other companies in this business who will treat you better than aaron    read more        i was  pre approved  by guaranteed rate after they had all of my information  including an extensive application and full access to my credit information  of course  i stopped dealing with other lenders who had made offers  i then entered into a months long process of responding to multiple requests for documentation  everything had been clearly spelled out in my application  but they needed corroboration  whenever i sent something  they would call a few days later and say that  underwriting  required something else  and that it was all on account of the new govt  regulations   and note that i was looking to consolidate the  st and  d mortgages on my home  and that the total i was asking for was less than     of my home s value  finally  i received a call from my loan contact saying that my credit card balance was too high  and they couldn t give me a loan unless i paid it off first  this was information they had had all along  before they  pre approved  me  in fact  my primary reason for re financing was to get my monthly mortgage payments lower and to pay off that credit card balance  i basically said that their response was not acceptable  and we eventually got it done  however  i would never recommend them the only thing i would give them high points for is responsiveness  at least until i agreed to go with them  they got back to me quicker than anyone  i didn t go with   other lenders who were offering similar rates because they weren t getting back to me as fast as gauranteed rate  once i went with them  however  the process dragged on for months  and they almost weren t going to give me the loan  buyers beware    read more        i worked with

exactly where i was in the process and helped me work on what to do next         i worked with a person name andrew leehy   he is a very hard working  honest person with the customers interest not the commission at heart         fred was awesome to work with  he is very knowledgeable in his field and is quick to respond to all calls and emails  he made sure the loan stayed on track and we closed on time     days from the day we put a contract on the house  we highly recommend fred         a fine bank with traditional values   just great   the people are real and the bank  walks the talk    a real pleasure to do business with them         joey was knowledgeable  very accessible and maintained a positive attitude throughout the complex refinancing process   he was a true partner  not just a functionary doing paperwork i trusted his judgment and he never failed me   he also has a great sense of humor         i was hesitant to use a non local mortgage company  my loan officer  jeremy was more involved with the process than any local loan company i ve used previously  his customer service and knowledge has exceeded my expectations  i don t usually recommend people  but i would consider jeremy as a trusted  friend in the mortgage business          i was hesitant to use a non local mortgage company  my loan officer  jeremy was more involved with the process than any local loan company i ve used previously  his customer service and knowledge has exceeded my expectations  i don t usually recommend people  but i would consider jeremy as a trusted  friend in the mortgage business          steve got it done when others couldn t     day closing and he even got things done that his supervisor couldn t get done  steve was recommended to me by a friend and i am glad i went with him  he

big move for us   i can t praise him highly enough   highly recommend         great bank with great products   easily the best bank i ve worked with           dallas is very experienced and knowledgeable   above all  he understand that customer service is to be no less than        rain or shine dallas was always available and never once missed a deadline or commitment to followup   while nasb obviously has given dallas the tools and resources to be successful  dallas is the reason our experience was so stellar          i was extremely impressed with the proffessionalism  the quality and speed of the quotes  the ability to communicate through my preferred methods and the speed to close  after speaking to several other loan officers  it was jon barrett at nasb that won us over  we couldnt have been happier with the service  great work           i was extremely impressed with the proffessionalism   quality and speed of the quotes  the ability to communicate through my preferred methods and the speed to close  after speaking to several other loan officers  it was jon barrett at nasb that won us over  we couldnt have been happier with the service  great work           rc malcolm was excellent  he stayed on top of everything to ensure that we were able to close on the projected close date  everything went very smooth and i would recommend rc to anyone looking for a mortgage lender          excellent service   rc stayed on top of everythign to make sure we closed on target    i would recommend to anyone looking for a home loan          they completed everything on time to get us through a quick closing  so helpful         brad was helpful through the entire process  as first time home buyers  my fiance  and i felt so much better with brad s expertise and guidance         i will recommend everyone i know to nasb and dallas goodlet  i had the best experience possible  i ve had many mortgages over my lifetime and this was by far  the most pleasurable  we received a great rate  the fees were low  and the service that dallas provides is unmatched  i m  not talking just about the mortgage industry  his service is the best i ve experienced in any industry  maybe ever  dallas may want to quit the mortgage business and start a customer service consultation business  very satisfied customer     read more        our refinance process was a dream once we spoke with dallas  and chose him and his bank   my husband spoke to quite a few lenders and when we got on the phone with dallas  our choice was firm  why is he great   because  i know we drove him crazy    we made it extra stressful on him by being technologically illiterate   as a matter of fact  i m having my grandson type the review  dallas was so patient and understanding with us   we had to snail mail all of the documents  we had a million questions for him  and he was a professional the entire time  he has to be one of the kindest and most empathetic people i ve ever came across   i m    years old and i ve had many  many  home buying and refinancing experiences  and by far  this was the easiest and most pleasurable   if you want someone who truly has your best interests at heart and someone you can completely trust  then give dallas a call   i ve already recommended my daughter to him     read more        the closing process for a va loan went smoothly   but the loan servicing by this so called bank is a complete disaster i set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website   unlike other banks with which i do business  the nasb website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries for the first    months  payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled   however  when the escrow amount changed  nasb debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance    unlike every other bank i have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited nasb sent me a  credit counseling letter  telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of     and change      and suggested credit counseling services   when i called their servicing department  the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current two weeks later  i received a total of two voice mail messages and an e mail in a span of    minutes from nasb s default department   the woman with whom i first spoke was rude  said she showed no record of my earlier call  it was my problem  and then hung up on me   the second agent  a man in their default department  said that he did not show that i had made any automatic payments and that nasb s system was not set up to adjust anything after having over    years of mortgage payments with various banks  i have never experienced such incompetence and rude service   i specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran    read more        miserable experience  they screwed up everything imaginable and never accepted responsibility for any of their errors  i wouldnt recommend them for the purchase of a doghouse much less purchasing a new home          our loan officer was happy to communicate before we committed  once we committed he only communicated with us after i questioned items and problems and after i questioned why we weren t settling before our rate lock expired  we had no idea where we were in the process unless i contacted steve  poor  poor communication  mr  kang also was  sure  our house would appraise for    k more than our house did  talking us into a loan that we didn t end up appraising for and then causing us to have to refinance at only     lower than our current mortgage  our appraiser was disorganized and called twice for pictures he forgot  he used poor comps  we were contacted several times to look at documents that were expired before we could even sign on  within minutes of the email notifications   only good was the actual settlement with a very sweet and competent notary  and thank goodness we were done   poor process  poor communication   we will never recommend nasb and i have already told two people refinancing to steer clear     read more        our loan officer was happy to communicate before we committed  once we committed he only communicated with us after i

problem with a credit card fro   years earlier  which must of made the loan not possible  this i would of understood  but i never heard from them again  called nick several times no response  i even called his supervisor no response  e mailed them no response  is this the company you want to due busness with                read more        can someone explain why the apr is more than a point higher than the interest rate  if there are    fees           this loan started off quite well  our rep  donna  was friendly and quick to respond to questions  she clearly explained how things would unfold  and it all sounded great  what i didn t count on was that the bank never kept a single promise she made  i had the same problem with this bank    or more times  i would ask for assurance about something  donna would respond that things would be completed as i wished  and her promise was violated by the bank every single time  for example  in our first or second conversation  i explained to donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country    weeks after beginning the loan process  would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that  not at all  she said  we should close several weeks before my wife s departure     weeks later  the bank was not ready to close  how did that happen  donna would ask us to email documentation  which we would email back within      hours  depending on the occasion  donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great  and the bank had everything it needed  then  weeks later  they would ask for additional documentation  this happened   or more times  later in the process  they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had i provided was now  too old   i cannot tell if this patterns recured because the bank doesn t care about customers  or because it is just incompetent  every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn t kept  donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry  but she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises  we finally closed    weeks or so after our initial application  i can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the bank on the day they made it  and if we hadn t pushed hard to get this deal done  this bank treats customers with complete disrespect  as someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than    home mortgages from different banks  i can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience i ve ever had  you owe it to yourself to work with another bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers  if i could  i d rate this bank lower than one star    read more        built new home and wanted to get a small mortgage compared to the value of the property  the process took much longer than i was told it would causing mishandling and reverification of information provided to nasb  there was a difference of opinion on what was necessary to close the loan that made the process diffiicult on my family  i would not recommend north american savings bank as amortgage lender    read more        this lender contacted my previous phone number which i did not list when registering with this site  very unprofessional  and very disturbing         i never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as i  that mistake was using north american savings bank over other lenders  i started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time  communication with the company was below average after i confirmed that i would be pursuing a loan with them  i had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me  the company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn t  this led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent  after having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped  when i was able to reach the loan officer i was told that i would personally have to find additional comps in my area  i was more than a little annoyed as this is what i was going to be paying them for  however i complied  after contacting area realtors and securing what i believe were suitable comps i forwarded them to the officer  a week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered  at that time i was told that my comps weren t sufficient and as a result they couldn t ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment s findings  as a result they would not be issuing me a loan  by the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point  i should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me  he did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me  i m now stuck with a      assessment that other banks are telling me that i can t use  in other words i will have to pay for a new assessment  i m also out the money for credit reports and of course i ll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan i secure  i was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money i had spent  i expect to be paying for my mistake for years  i should point out that i refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues  i strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass north american savings bank no matter what they promise  save yourself time  money and a lot of aggravation    read more        it all started when bob g ran a credit check without my knowledge or consent  when i agreed to use nasb  bob told me that they could close in less than   weeks   it took    the day before closing they were still asking for paperwork  the day of closing  while my household goods were being unpacked  i was told a power of attorney could not be used  i had to fly to id  where my wife was  take the docs to a notary and fedex them back  i also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn t accept a personal check  then five days later  while driving from id to nc  i had to coordinate having closing docs  which i already sent to them  from the sale of my other home sent to me so i could send to them  of the four houses i purchased in the past   years this was the most stressful    read more        what a horrible experience  we have excellent credit  plenty of income  etc  nasb rep made tons of promises to get us to sign up  but then just a few weeks before the closing  she just disappeared  and failed to give us a lock or firm closing date  thankfully  we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with lower rates in only   weeks  nasb rep constantly complained about being too busy and having too many matters to work on  this became very apparent towards the end  not sure to this day why she didn t want our business other than they apparently cannot follow through for some reason or another  i m sure there are good lenders here  but this is not one of them    read more        rep was extremely professional  friendly  and helpful when we first spoke  in fact  from my initial round of calls  i thought i was going to select him out of the five lending tree lenders  plus two banks i talked to directly   but then when i sent an email to all the lenders saying  ok  the contract is signed  i want to select a lender and lock my rate tomorrow  so please send me your best current rate and fees etc  with these exact loan parameters  it took the rep from nasb over a week to respond  so i replied to him  thanks but you are too late  i have selected someone else and already locked my rate   over the following few weeks i continued to receive emails from him saying  when you are ready to proceed with your loan  let me know   we closed on january  th  and on february  th i got another such email  i guess he didn t really ever read my emails  i also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat  but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too  at the end of round one  his rates and fees were very competitive though   pretty near the best of the bunch    read more        i was working with a loan consultant from nasb and she told me that she would give me a rate of        for a    year fixed loan with a total closing cost of        i asked her to send me the good faith estimate  the good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of       which is about      more than she mentioned during our conversation  when i called her for explanation of the extra      she said that there is a state tax        which she was not aware of  what an explanation     she knew my state from the beginning and i repeatedly asked her for a  total  closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be        as a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a  state tax  that might come later and should have mentioned that to me  i am not supposed to know what are the different compoents fees or taxes that apply during closing  she does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning  i expected honest communication from a loan consultant from nasb bank and i did not receive that  i am very disappointed    read more        '"
